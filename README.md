# Indecisive Support

Welcome to **Indecisive**, an AI-powered decision-making app designed to provide unique and diverse perspectives to help you make better choices. Developed entirely by me, Elliott Tamarkin, this app is a product of my passion for technology and problem-solving. Your support means the world to me, and I am deeply grateful for your trust and enthusiasm.

## About the App

Indecisive allows users to select a category and input their question, after which they can choose from 10 unique advisors. Each advisor has a distinct personality, such as a comedian, a wise sage, or an analytical thinker, and uses AI to deliver tailored advice and perspectives.

Whether you're stuck choosing a restaurant, deciding on your next vacation spot, or debating a big life decision, Indecisive is here to provide clarity and insights!

## Support and Contact

If you have any questions, need assistance, or would like to share feedback, please feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always available to help and would love to hear from you!
